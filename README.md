# Tabu-search
Implementation of Tabu search on python to find solution of the Travelling Salesman problem(100 cities)


This project was a part of my university course (design and analysis of algorithms). Here I implement tabu search to find approximate solutions of the travelling salesman problem (of 100 cities). It takes input of the graph as an adjacency matrix stored in a spreadsheet(cmr.xlsx) and runs the algorithm 10000 times and visualizes the reduction of costs with new generations.

Requirements: Python=3.6 and Matplotlib>=3.1.1
